# Front End Project: JavaScript Calculator
__for [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries/front-end-development-libraries-projects/build-a-javascript-calculator)__

[Click](https://grivdm.github.io/Calculator/)
_(for better experience, close test bar)_  

This is a Calulator built using React, Redux Toolkit, and Bootstrap.  

I believe that the calculator is not required in the presentation and instructions, just use it like any other calculators.  
A toggle switch is for passing tests (changes the logic of symbols handling)
